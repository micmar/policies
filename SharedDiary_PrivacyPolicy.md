#Shared Diary: Privacy policy

Shared Diary is a simple App that by using Firebase aims to allow a group of users to 
create a common diary, with pictures, texts and locations.
The idea is that users that share (for example) a travel experience, could share photos
and memories.

This app does not collect in any possible way user data, nor personable identifiable information.

There are no reference to any sort of violence, gambling or adult-reserved content.

This app has been developed by Michele Marchetti.
